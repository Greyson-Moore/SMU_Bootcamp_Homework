Description:
The files folder contains two excel workbooks that order a large amount of stock data by year. A VBA
macro was created and run on the code in order to calculate the yearly change in price, the percent change in 
price and the total volume of the stock. The code also keeps track of the greatest increase and decrease in stock
price as well as the greatest stock volume. The scrpit had an error that did not allow it to divide by 0 and
the code was unable to run through the complete data set. The images folder contains several screenshots of 
the code and the worksheets it worked on.

Analysis:
The average yearly change of the price of the stocks was 17.9. The average percent change was +21.48%. The average
total stock volume was 302896038. Though there were many outliers in the data set, this shows an overall
positive trend in stock prices and volumes traded. In 2014, stock "SD" had the greatest percent increase, increasing
by %11675. It increased in price from 0.2 to 23.35. Stock DYN.W performed the worst decreasing by -91.49%. It started at 
0.47 and decreased to 0.04. Stock BAC had the greatest volume, moving a total of 2.7429*10^10. It only had a small
increase in price, increasing by 5.27 which was a 31.31% increase.
