PyBank:
This program reads in data from a .csv, sorts it and prints it to the terminal and results.txt. The 
file it reads from contains monthly profit/losses of a company in a folder called resources. The program 
calculates the differences in the profit/losses and determines the change from month to month. It also 
calculates the total change as well as the greatest profit and loss. It prints the results to the terminal and to 'PyBank/Results' 
in a file titled 'results.txt'.

PyPoll:
This program reads in data from a .csv, sorts it and prints it to the terminal and results.txt. The 
file it reads from contains voter ids', county that voting occured, and who the vote was placed for.
The program sorts through the .csv in the Resources folder and determines the amount of votes each
candidate received. It also declares a winner. The results are printed to the terminal and to
'PyPoll/Results' in a file titled 'results.txt'
