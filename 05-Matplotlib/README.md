SMU Data Analysis

Description:
The program organizes and displays data from a medical trial performed on mice. It studies the effects of tumor growth using several
different drug regimen. The program reads in the data, and creates several graphs and plots in order to visual the relationships
between the different data points.

Pymaceuticals:
Contains the main program and the data folder which holds two csv files.

Images:
Contains screenshots of the code and graphs

Analysis:
-Maximum tumor volume remained largely consistent. Only one outlier was found in the entire data set.
-The Capomulin drug only seemed to affect tumor growth early in the delivery of the drug. After a sharp
decrease tumor growth continued consistently.
-There is a strong correlation between weight and average tumor size. The relationship is direct and as a test
subject's weight increased, the tumor size did as well.
